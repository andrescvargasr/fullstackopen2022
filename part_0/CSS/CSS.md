# CSS basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started.

## What is CSS?

Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```
